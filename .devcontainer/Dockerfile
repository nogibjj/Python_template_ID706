# A regular Docker container is like a machine that runs independently. 
# It is a self-contained environment that can be started, stopped, and managed as a whole. 
# However, to make changes to its configuration or contents, you typically need to stop the container,
# make the changes, and then start it again. It's akin to turning off a car to adjust its settings 
# or make modifications.

# VS Code Dev Containers, on the other hand, are like a machine (container) that you can 
# customize and modify while it's running. They provide a dynamic and integrated development 
# environment within the VS Code IDE. You can change the settings, install extensions, and 
# make configuration adjustments on-the-fly without needing to stop and restart the entire 
# environment. It's similar to adjusting settings in your car while driving without needing 
# to turn off the engine.
